//This contract exploits a reentrancy condition in the MOONBIRDS contract to purchase 'nested' birds that are listed on LooksRare
//The MOONBIRDS project issues awards and airdrops to birds that are nested
//Unnesting a bird causes it to lose it's current "streak"
//So nested birds are more valuable, but they are not allowed to transfer when in nested state
//This contract is a proof of concept on how to exploit the reentrancy condition to get around the protection mechanism in the MOONBIRDS contract
//The safeTransferWhileNesting function sets the value of nestingTransfer to 2 in the MOONBIRDS contract
//As long as nestingTransfer is set to 2, transfers are allowed
//When safeTransferWhileNesting is called to send a bird to a contract (not a regular wallet), the safeTransferFrom function
//checks to see if the contract implements IERC721Receiver (which this contract does) and in turn calls back the onERC721Received function
//on the destination contract which we have implemented. In our onERC721Received, we make the purchase for the target nested bird because we know
//that nestingTransfer is still 2 and so it will go through.
